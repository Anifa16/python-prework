    <p>Hey The cool person who just visited my site, my name is Anifa Chishungu, a mother of 3 and a wife to my amazing husband.<br>
       I'm from Congo, migrated to the United State in 2010 when I was 12 years old. as a kid I had a big dream of becoming a police office<br>
        Went to school persu that Career path but after a while I realized that I wanted to do something differet with my life, that is how I fall into tech. <br>
        For me tech has always been an gaint that I felt I wasn't smart enough to achive, infact I feel like I went into criminal justice because <br> 
        it did not require so much brain pawer to do the job. After I got intruduced into tech in 2020 by a wonderful program called YearUp I knew<br>
        right a way this was what I wanted to do.
        <br> 
        
        </br>
        I fell inlove with the coding, with createing something that has never been created before. I fell inlove<br>
        with the amount of thinking you has to do to solve a single preblom. I truely enjoy the idea of bring an idea to life, something that someone has never seen before<br>
        currentlyi'm a quality Assurence Engineer and even though I enjoy my job to much i know that technology is changing every day and if you are not keeping up with the treads will be left behind.
        this being said I'm striving to become a software engineer and hopefully I can get to code with the big boys and contrubite to building cools apps like Imprints Payments or Amazon, Google the list goes on and on.
